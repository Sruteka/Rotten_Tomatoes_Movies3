# üè† NYC Airbnb Data Analysis: Supervised & Unsupervised Learning üß†  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **AB_NYC_2019** dataset, which contains Airbnb listings in New York City. By applying **supervised** and **unsupervised learning**, we:  
1. **Predicted prices** of Airbnb listings (Supervised Learning).  
2. **Clustered listings** based on key features (Unsupervised Learning).  

The project provides insights into pricing patterns, popular neighborhoods, and groups Airbnb properties into meaningful clusters for analysis.
